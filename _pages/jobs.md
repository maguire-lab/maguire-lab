# Open positions

## Postdoctoral Positions

**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional postdoctoral positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [Killam](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/gradstudies/programs/postdoctoral-fellows/postdoctoral-fellowships/killam-pdfs.html) and [Banting Fellowships](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html)**

## PhD Studentship

Open positions are available if you have a specific project you are interested in and wish to jointly develop a scholarship application.
Details of the application process including timelines can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dizV5CEkasOZD_lmbiPf0akGC3Opm99VGN41IQFj64U/edit).

### Funded PhD developing tools for the diagnosis and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance

**Project**: development of methods for automatically identifying novel and evolving antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. This will build on existing efforts to characterise AMR genes in large genome databases and will incorporate genomic, phylogenetic, spatiotemporal, and phenotypic data. 

This project will involve existing collaborations with clinicians (Toronto’s Shared Hospital Laboratory and Sunnybrook Research Institute), public health agencies (PHAC/NML & CFIA/NCFAD), and infectious disease researchers including local experts in evolutionary microbiology and Dr. Andrew McArthur’s Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (card.mcmaster.ca) group at McMaster University.

Candidates should have:
- A Masters degree in any of Computer Science, Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Epidemiology or related fields.  
- GPA of at least 3.4/4 (approx. 3.7/4.3 or or 8.6/10 or 17/20) or equivalent.
- Demonstrated fluency in English (e.g., first language, degrees taught in English, IELTS (all categories of >=7), TOEFL (>=95) or equivalent test results).
- Experience with data visualisation and analysis including familiarity with a scripting language (e.g., Python).
- Ability to work independently and within a team environment
- Effective oral and written communication, analytical, and interpersonal skills. 

Prior experience in bioinformatics is not necessary but it is not desired.  We encourage all qualified applicants to apply.
This lab is strongly committed to diversity within its community and especially welcomes applications from racialized persons / persons of colour, women, Indigenous / Aboriginal People of North America, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ2S+ persons, and others who may contribute to the further diversification of ideas. Our values regarding equity and diversity are linked with our commitment to excellence in the pursuit of our academic mission.

Interested individuals should send:
- Brief cover letter including which project you are interested in and why, most relevant experience, and career goals.
- CV detailing academic training and research to date.
- Unofficial academic transcripts.

Applicants who meet preliminary screening will be invited for an interview and 2 references will be requested prior to final hiring decisions.

Please send applications to [finlay.maguire@dal.ca](mailto:finlay.maguire@dal.ca). In the body of your email, please mention your earliest availability date.
Keywords: Algorithms; Biomedical; Biostatistics; Infectious Diseases; Computational Machine Learning; Microbial Pathogenomics

## Research in Medicine or Residency Research Projects

If you are a medical student or resident that wishes to do a research project in health data science (or more specific infectious disease/medical microbiology computational work) please send me an [email](mailto:finlay.maguire@dal.ca) and we have a chat!

## Undergraduate Project Students

If you are interested in pursuing a summer internship or honours project, please send me an [email](mailto:finlay.maguire@dal.ca) early in the academic year so we can try and apply for funding to pay you (e.g., NSERC USRA). State why you are interested, the sort of project you would like to do, and attach your CV. If you are applying to fulfill specific program requirements (e.g., honours), note this in your email!

Current projects that would be a good fit (although if you have your own idea please get in touch):

- Infectious Disease Bioinformatics/Genomic Epidemiology: Working with clinicians, public health experts to continue development of the [Evolving Threat Detector](https://github.com/fmaguire/evoling_threat_detector). This is a tool that is designed to identify and report new evolving resistance to antibiotics. Great fit for any student interested in front-end development, microbial bioinformatics, machine learning, and/or working as part of an international consortia.

- Computational Social Science/Health Data Science: Working with social scientists to develop a database and front-end to support qualitative and natural language processing analyses of text data scraped from social media websites. The goal of this broader project is to characterise radicalisation in online spaces.

- Genomic epidemiology of zoonotic viruses
