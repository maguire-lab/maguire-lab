# Open positions

## Postdoctoral Positions

**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional postdoctoral positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [Killam](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/gradstudies/programs/postdoctoral-fellows/postdoctoral-fellowships/killam-pdfs.html) and [Banting Fellowships](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html)**

## PhD Studentship

### Novel Metagenomic Approaches to Inferring the Evolution of Infectious Diseases

Metagenomics is the sequencing the DNA from an entire microbial community at once. This type of data is used to try to understand and prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance and diseases such as COVID-19.  Metagenomic data is big, fragmented, and noisy so presents distinct algorithmic challenges.  This work will involve development of new software based on graph theory, machine learning, and model-based optimisation to systematically map patterns of evolution in clinical/public health datasets.  
We are hiring two funded PhD students and the ideal candidates will have a strong interest in bioinformatics, graph theory, and working with clinical and government collaborators.

**Project 1**: focuses on the systematic optimisation of complex bioinformatics workflows using sequential-model based optimisation approaches. This will be used to improve and extend existing approaches for the use of metagenomic data for rapid diagnostics and surveillance of new emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance.

**Project 2**: will extended work with [Sarand](https://github.com/somayeh-aut/sarand) to develop graph theory and machine learning approaches to track and predict the evolution of antimicrobial resistance between clinical, agricultural, urban, and wildlife samples.

If you are interested in either project or have an idea related to them please send me an [email](mailto:finlay.maguire@dal.ca) with your CV attached and we can arrange a chat!

## Research in Medicine or Residency Research Projects

If you are a medical student or resident that wishes to do a research project in health data science (or more specific infectious disease/medical microbiology computational work) please send me an [email](mailto:finlay.maguire@dal.ca) and we have a chat!

## Undergraduate Project Students

If you are interested in pursuing a summer internship or honours project, please send me an [email](mailto:finlay.maguire@dal.ca) early in the academic year so we can try and apply for funding to pay you (e.g., NSERC USRA). State why you are interested, the sort of project you would like to do, and attach your CV. If you are applying to fulfill specific program requirements (e.g., honours), note this in your email!

Current projects that would be a good fit (although if you have your own idea :

- Computational Social Science: Using Natural Language Processing methods to investigate online radicalisation. Building on existing work with colleagues in Sociology (e.g., [recent qualitative work](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1097184X211017954)). Would be a great fit for any student interested in NLP, computational social science, social media data, or radicalisation.

- Infectious Disease Bioinformatics/Genomic Epidemiology: Working with clinicians, public health experts to continue development of the [Evolving Threat Detector](https://github.com/fmaguire/evoling_threat_detector). This is a tool that is designed to identify and report new evolving resistance to antibiotics. Great fit for any student interested in front-end development, microbial bioinformatics, machine learning, and/or working as part of an international consortia.
