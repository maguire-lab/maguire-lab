We are a research group jointly based in [Dalhousie's](https://dal.ca) [Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience.html) and the [Faculty of Medicine's](https://medicine.dal.ca) [Department of Community Health & Epidemiology](https://medicine.dal.ca/departments/department-sites/community-health.html).

Our aim is to develop and collaboratively apply data-driven methods to try and mitigate health and social crises.
This is focused on two main areas: genomic epidemiology of infectious diseases and inter-disciplinary collaborations with domain experts 

Specifically, this former work involves developing and applying novel microbial bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to better understand the diagnosis, evolution, and dynamics of infectious diseases.
We largely work on problems related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and, in the last couple of years, the COVID-19 pandemic with national and international consortia of clinicians and public health experts.
Whereas, our broader collaborative data science works includes work exploring online radicalisation with sociologists, patient preference at refugee clinics, and autism-related language-use.

We are located in Dalhousie University and have strong ties to the Shared Hospital Lab located at [Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre](https://sunnybrook.ca/), the [CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca), the [Canadian Food Inspection Agency](https://inspection.canada.ca/eng/1297964599443/1297965645317), and the [Public Health Agency of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health.html).
This also includes national and international public health consortia such as [IRIDA](https://irida.ca/), [CanCOGeN](https://www.genomecanada.ca/en/cancogen), and [PHA4GE](https://pha4ge.org).

### Joining the Lab 

 **We are looking for new enthusiastic and creative PhD students to [join the team]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/jobs)!**
