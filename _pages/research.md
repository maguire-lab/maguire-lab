## Genomic Epidemiology

This focused is largely focused around working with public health and clinicians to better understand the diagonsis, evolution, and dynamics of infectious diseases.
Specifically, we develop and apply microbial bioinformatics and machine learning approaches use genomic/metagenomic data to answer these types of questions.
This work largely focuses on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) with 

This involves close collaborations with the [Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database](card.mcmaster.ca/), [Public Health Agency of Canada's](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health.html) [National Microbiology Lab](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/programs/national-microbiology-laboratory.html), [Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada](https://agriculture.canada.ca/en), the [Canadian Food Inspection Agency](https://inspection.canada.ca/eng/1297964599443/1297965645317).


collaborators in [Prof. Robert Beiko's] and [Prof. Andrew McArthur's] groups



As of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic we have been actively involved in the development of [viral genomic analysis workflows](github.com/jaleezyy/covid-19-signal), [quality control metrics](github.com/jts/ncov-tools/), and [lineage assignment tools](github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin). We have also 




Through this we actively contribute to several national and international public health consortia including the [Canadian COVID Genomics Network](https://www.genomecanada.ca/en/cancogen) (CanCOGeN) and [Public Health Alliance For Genomic Epidemiology](https://pha4ge.org/) (PHA4GE).
We also have strong ties and lead pathogenomic bioinformatics for [Sunnybrook's](https://sunnybrook.ca/research/) Shared Hospital Laboratory 
Our work in these areas have been funded by [CIHR](), [Genome Canada](), and [JPI-AMR]().
