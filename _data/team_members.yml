  project: NSERC Discovery Grant-funded project based on the development and application of tools to detect lateral gene transfer (LGT) of genes with important microbial functions (such as antimicrobial resistance) from metagenomic assembly graphs. This involves a One Health focus with a priority on identifying intersectoral LGT events (i.e., those between clinical, environmental, agricultural environments).
